<h1>Changing File Permissions</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved using the chmod o-w project_k.txt command to modify the file permissions of project_k.txt, effectively removing write permissions for others. By limiting others' access to read-only, the security concern was addressed, ensuring that the file can only be modified by the owner and group. This aligns with best practices for securing sensitive or shared files. The updated permissions can be verified using the ls -la command.
